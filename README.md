# Training Days
## Project #26 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
Training Days is a simple program for running athletes that gives them a random event (marathon, triathlon, or pentathlon) and their time to train for it (50, 100, or 200 days). The aim of this project is to fix the wrong scope of the variables to make the program run properly, as shown in the starter code.
## What I Learned
  - The global and local scopes of variables and their importance in maintenance and debugging
  - Causes of ReferenceError
